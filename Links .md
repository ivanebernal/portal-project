**Limitations:**
Group video calls are subject to a fair usage limit of 100 hours per month 
with no more than 10 hours per day and a limit of 4 hours per individual video call. 
Once these limits have been reached, the video will switch off and the call will convert to an audio call. 
If a participant of a group video call is not on a version of Internet Communications Software 
that supports group video calls, then the call will be an audio call only for that participant. 
The number of permitted participants on a group video call varies from 3 to a maximum of 10, 
depending upon device and associated system requirements.
