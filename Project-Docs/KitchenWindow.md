**What is Kitchen Window?**

Kitchen window is a project to establish audiovisual communication in real time between three Nearsoft offices   
located on different cities, using a screen embedded in a  window frame to simulate that you are looking the other   
office through a regular home-like window.

**Why Kitchen Window?**

In Nearsoft the culture it's very important, it is consider as one of their main pilars, and by having offices in   
different cities is difficult to maintain the same culture over all of them, so Kitchen Window is a way for having a direct  
connection in real time with the three offices so people of Nearsoft can share its culture more naturally. 

**Who are involved in Kitchen Window?**

It is a project developed by the interns of the **Nearsoft Academy** (2016-I)  
to be used by all the Nersoftians in the three Nearsoft offices (Hermosillo, Chihuahua & Mexico City).
