**What is Kitchen Window?**

Kitchen window is a project to establish real-time communication between  two Nearsoft offices each located on different cities through an audiovisual system build as a kitchen window offering a comfortable interface and a pleasant experience.

**Why Kitchen Window?**

In Nearsoft the culture it's very important, it is consider as one of their main pilars, and by having offices in   
different cities is difficult to maintain the same culture over all of them, so Kitchen Window is a way for having a direct  
connection in real time with the three offices so people of Nearsoft can share its culture more naturally.

It is a project developed by the interns of the **Nearsoft Academy** (2016-I)
